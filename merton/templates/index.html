This is the index file that is loaded on startup. The general layout
for these webpages is to extend 'base.html', which acts as a
formatter. We'll go with this approach for a bit to see if it works.

In 1964 and 1965 Thomas Merton used a red-leather "day-by-day" calendar for the year 1959 as a diary. Unlike his other published diaries and journals, this diary was not used for personal entries; rather he used it as a collection for the words of others. As noted by Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis and Jonathan Montaldo in the <a href="/display/preface">Foreword</a> to the print edition, "the Red Diary is a convergence of Merton's spontaneous attractions." This collection of the thoughts and writings of others provide us with insight into Merton's "interior climate" - "these collected'words' reflect his fears and his hopes, and more importantly they reflect his prayer, at this new and long awaited juncture in his life" - that of living full-time at his hermitage.
